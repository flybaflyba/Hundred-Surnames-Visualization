President Steven C. Wheelwright makes an announcement clarifying BYUâ€“Hawaii\'s two-fold, student-centered mission: "To integrate both spiritual and secular learning, and to prepare students with character and integrity who can provide leadership in their families, their communities,their chosen fields, and in building the kingdom of God." This mission further translates into two immediate imperatives: to continue to improve the quality of students\' educational experience, and to significantly lower the cost of that education to the Church.
